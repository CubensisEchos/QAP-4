## QAP 4 JAVA
This Java program was made as a project for my Java course. Its purpose is to provide a working and interactive menu for adding/viewing drugs, and patients. It also has an exit program function and shows how I can store info within a data file that persists (how drug info is stored), 
or use a database(how patient info is stored). 

# Project questions
1. 10-20 hours
2. Stack Overflow, Reddit, Youtube, as well as your class notes.
3. No
4. No
5. I'd give it a 3/5, but any issues felt solved, so I feel it would be easy to do a similar program in the future.
